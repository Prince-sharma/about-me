# A Tale of Compatibility on the Web

Compatibility of applications for any platform is hard. But for the web it's even harder. We don't just have to deal with multiple versions of operating systems. No, we have deal with multiple browsers on different operating systems supporting not just one language but multiple ones. We got HTML, CSS, the JavaScript standard and the DOM API of JavaScript and what about all the forgotten ones like VBScript.

We'll look at how difficult compatibility on the web really is, what browser vendors and standard bodies partially have to do to avoid breaking the web, how HTML and CSS differ from JavaScript and look into some interesting parts of standards like Appendix B of the ECMA262 aka ECMAScript.
