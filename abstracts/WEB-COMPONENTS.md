# 2018 - The Year of Web Components

Components are hot. Every view library or framework seems to be based on components these days. But when you write your React component you can't share it with an Angular developer. Your Vue components can't be used in Preact. The result: fragmentation. The cost: reinventing the wheel for every library. 

We've had the answer for years, though. Web components are the standards based solution, but they've never seemed ready for the big time. Until now.

In this talk we'll look at why 2018 is finally the year of web components, the tools and libraries that we can use to build with web components and how you can get started building shareable, compatible, standards based components.
