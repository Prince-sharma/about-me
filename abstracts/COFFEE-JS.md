# Coffee.js - How I hacked my coffee machine using JavaScript

Home automation should make our lives easier, but my Echo can't make me coffee. As a developer who turns caffeine into code, this is unacceptable. The only thing to do was use code to make coffee.
 
This is the story of how I hacked an API onto my coffee machine. We'll look at why you would chose JavaScript to hack the machine, what you need to do to take control of a coffee machine (without too many shocks), and what other things we can do with JavaScript and hardware. As we wrap up with a look at what's next for my project, you'll be dreaming of the gadgets in your house that you can't wait to rip open and give an API.
